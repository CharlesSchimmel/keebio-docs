# Flashing Firmware

Still in progress...

Check out [flashing guide for the Let's Split](https://github.com/nicinabox/lets-split-guide/blob/master/flashing.md) in the meantime.

A couple of notes:

* Initially, you do need to have both sides flashed, as that allows both sides to talk to each other using the same communication protocol
* Once both sides are flashed, you only need to flash the master side if you are just updating the keymap

## Creating your own layout
