# Troubleshooting Guide

Still in progress...

* Pro Micro lights up but no presses register

  * Inverted Pro Micro

  * inverted diodes

  * Check with default hex

* My right side is inverted if I plug it in by itself

* Doesn't work if I insert the Pro Micro and have it touch the pins but haven't soldered yet

* left side works, right side doesn't

  * Check cable type

  * Does Pro Micro on right side light up?

    * No? Multimeter continuity and VCC checks

  * If I2C, check jumper

* Dead column

  * Try jumping directly on Pro Micro, if works, solder jumper wire to column

* Check USB cable in case it's power only
