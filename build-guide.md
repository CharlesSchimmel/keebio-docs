## Soldering the Components

Bare PCB, older version \(1.1\) that only has 1 2u slot, but the same as the current version otherwise: ![](http://i.imgur.com/UnRgaYM.jpg)

Solder on the TRRS jack, diodes, and resistors \(optional\):![](http://i.imgur.com/UVY8ShN.jpg)

The line on the diodes should face the square pad:![](http://i.imgur.com/khwqsVL.jpg)

Solder the TRRS jumpers on the side with the jack:![](http://i.imgur.com/6AIYGB1.jpg)

Make sure the jumpers on the side without the jack are not soldered:![](http://i.imgur.com/CpzkAcz.jpg)

If doing I2C, solder the I2C jumper:![](http://i.imgur.com/B9iE9mS.jpg)

Solder in the Pro Micro header pins. The header pins are flipped upside down here to make removing the plastic a lot easier:![](http://i.imgur.com/3Ncr2Zr.jpg)

Plastic removed from the header pins to make everything as low profiles as possible:![](http://i.imgur.com/kVvdj6B.jpg)
