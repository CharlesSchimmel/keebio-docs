   4. Solder Pro Micro header pins
2. Add 2u stabilizers
3. Solder switches
4. Flash Pro Micros
5. Solder Pro Micros
6. Solder RGB strip \(optional\)

## Soldering the Components

Bare PCB, older version \(1.1\) that only has 1 2u slot, but the same as the current version otherwise: ![](http://i.imgur.com/UnRgaYM.jpg)

Solder on the TRRS jack, diodes, and resistors \(optional\):![](http://i.imgur.com/UVY8ShN.jpg)

The line on the diodes should face the square pad:![](http://i.imgur.com/khwqsVL.jpg)

Soldering of diodes complete:![](http://i.imgur.com/PxDnA8H.jpg)

Solder the TRRS jumpers on the side with the jack:![](http://i.imgur.com/6AIYGB1.jpg)

Make sure the jumpers on the side without the jack are not soldered:![](http://i.imgur.com/CpzkAcz.jpg)

If doing I2C, solder the I2C jumper:![](http://i.imgur.com/B9iE9mS.jpg)

Solder in the Pro Micro header pins. The header pins are flipped upside down here to make removing the plastic a lot easier:![](http://i.imgur.com/3Ncr2Zr.jpg)

Plastic removed from the header pins to make everything as low profiles as possible:![](http://i.imgur.com/kVvdj6B.jpg)

Solder on the right-angle reset pushbutton:![](http://i.imgur.com/qSDyQE9.jpg)

## Add 2u stabilizers \(optional\)

If you are doing 2u keys with stabilizers, install the stabilizers now. Make sure the bottom of the stabilizer snaps into the PCB.

## Add switches
